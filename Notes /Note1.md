#Why React ?
- Phantom/Ghost message problem --> No consistency in UI
- (state - JS) need to create a syn bwt them (UI - DOM)
- React is a library
- Framework - Military AND Library - Cool Dude
- ONGOING PROCESS.

---------------

- Vite or parcel --> bundler : combined files of javascript
- React library (Core library)


##Creating a react app

- npx create-react-app name {Not prefered -- bulky utility} (Node package executer)
- cd name
- First analyse package.Json Check everything -- Entry Point
- react and react dom main library , web-vitals - performance tracker
- script - production ko run krte hai 
- ls to list 
- npm run start/npm start --> exception 
- production mai build folder he serve krta hai 

- NOWW 
- npm create vite@latest
- Select framework
- npm i -- to install the node modules
- npm run dev

- Starting bekar file for us -- setip.testjs,report-web-vitals,logo.scg,app.test,app.css,index.css
- Librarry main doesn't matter much
- Know how to clean the code 
- gitignore - to ignore the modules not to be uploaded in git 
- package-lock.json - dependencies lock ho jate hai ki eshe version par chalega
- manifest.json - mobile application ke metatext ko dekhne ke liye use hote hai
- robots.txt - search engine ke liye hai
- index.html -- MAIN 
- Component try to name name.jsx as a rule 
- Function name first as capital 
- JSX can return onlt one element using fragment(<></>)
- File name try to keep first letter capital
- REload using >re
- React js or jsx depends on what it returns but in vite only jsx works and fxn name should be in capital as well
- It is single paged as there is only one div named root
